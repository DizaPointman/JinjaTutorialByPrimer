{# templates/_navigation.html #}

{# Instead of adding the navigation menu code directly into base.html, you can leverage the {% include %} tag. 
By referencing another template with {% include %}, youâ€™re loading the whole template into that position.
Included templates are partials that contain a fraction of the full HTML code. To indicate that a template is 
meant to be included, you can prefix its name with an underscore (_).#}

<nav>
    {% for menu_item in ["home", "results"] %}
    <a href="{{ url_for(menu_item) }}">{{ menu_item }}</a>
    {% endfor %}
